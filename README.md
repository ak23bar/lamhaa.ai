# Lamhaa.ai

**Lamhaa.ai** is an AI-powered image organization tool that intelligently curates your photo collections by content relevance and visual quality. It analyzes uploaded images to identify your best shots, group similar photos, and filter out low-quality ones — all through an automated and scalable backend.

The name *Lamhaa* (لمحہ) comes from the Urdu word for “moment” — reflecting the project’s goal of helping users rediscover meaningful moments through intelligent visual organization.
